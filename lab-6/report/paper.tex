\section{Introduction}
We aim to build the following system:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two Raspberry Pis are connected by Bluetooth, being either server (master) or client (slave).
  \item The server listens to user's speech commands, which are confined to five options: `activate white socket', `deactivate white socket', `activate yellow socket', `deactivate yellow socket', and `retrieve information'.
  \item The server sends the speech command to the client for processing.
  \item The client activates/deactivates white/yellow socket -- turns on/off respective electronic devices, or retrieves AC information from PZEM004T according to the given request.
  \item The client transmits a task failure/success message or the read AC information to the server.
  \item The server plays the received packet by audio for the user.
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

\section{Implementation}
We begin by pairing our Raspberry Pis. Since a Bluetooth master can serve 7 active slaves simultaneously, we must identify our slave to the master by sending a message (here as `initiate connection') from our client end. Once the two devices are bonded, the server starts listening to user's speech command using Speech-to-Text service provided by Google. The server then sends its interpretation to the server. If the command conforms with the format stated in the introduction section above, the client executes the job (we chose not to explain the details here because they have already been described in previous labs), transmitting a success message or the read AC information back to the server. Otherwise, the client yields the message `the given command does not exist', indicating a failed operation with the server. The server then uses Google Speech's Text-to-Speech to play the packet returned via its speakers. After the audio finishes playing, the server awaits the next command from the user, and the whole process is repeated. Our implementation is illustrated in the two subsections below.

\subsection{Server}

      r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=1)
      print("Say 'Activate/Deactivate white/yellow socket' or 'Retrieve information':")
      audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
      return r.recognize_google(audio, language="en-US")
    except speech_recognition.UnknownValueError:
      print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
      print("No response from Google Speech Recognition serve: {0}".format(e))

  with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True) as file:
    tts = gTTS(text=sentence, lang=lang)
    tts.save('{}.mp3'.format(file.name))
    mixer.init()
    mixer.music.load('{}.mp3'.format(file.name))
    mixer.music.play(loops_count)

  alarm       =   data[9]                              # 0 means no alarm
